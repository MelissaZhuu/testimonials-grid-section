## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass preprocessor

### What I learned

This project helped me understand CSS Grid and creating responsive designs a lot more. I was able to play around with different ways of structuring the code to avoid repetitive areas and I've learned to keep common code, that I used mixins for, as general as possible. I also tried to notice little details like adding the slight box-shadow to the white cards so they pop a little from the background, but I'm still working on not getting too caught up in creating a pixel-perfect design. In this project I also decided to create an intermediate, tablet media query as I noticed the transition between mobile and desktop looked too awkward.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to practice some JS and React and continue learning about handling different kinds of layouts.
